# ‚õè Leadminer

Leadminer is a tool to mine and transmute raw and passive contacts from your own communication tools (email mailbox, social networks) into actionable and qualified leads.

## Self-hosting and running Leadminer

Docker is the recommended solution for self-hosting Leadminer thanks to its convenience and ease of use.

### Run Leadminer using docker-compose

1. Clone the repository and enter `leadminer` folder

1. Copy [.env.example](/.env.example) to `.env` and add the missing required environment variables:

   - Supabase project url : `SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL`
   - Supabase project token : `SUPABASE_SECRET_PROJECT_TOKEN`
   - Postgres connection string : `PG_CONNECTION_STRING`
   - Google client Id : `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
   - Google secret: `GOOGLE_SECRET`

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Start docker-compose:

```sh
docker-compose up --build --force-recreate
```

4. Navigate to `localhost:8080`.

### Run Leadminer locally

You can easily get started with development mode by following theses steps:

1. Install the required dependencies

```sh
npm run install-deps
```

1. Start supabase services and take note of the supabase project token to use it in the next step.

```sh
# Start supabase services
npm run dev:supabase
```

2. Copy `/frontend/.env.example` to `/frontend/.env` and `/backend/.env.example` to `/backend/.env` respectively and set the missing required variables

1. Start your environment by running the following commands:

```sh
# Start the Redis container  -- You can skip this step if you want to use your local instance
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up

# Start the backend in development mode
npm run dev:backend-api
npm run dev:backend-worker

# Start the frontend in development mode
npm run dev:frontend
```

### Generating a new migration for schema changes

- When altering the database schema or creating new tables, functions..., make sure to run these commands (While supabase services are up):

```sh
# Start supabase services
npx supabase start

# Make your changes from supabase studio

# List the changes that you made
npx supabase db diff --use-migra

# Create a migration for the changes that you have made
npx supabase db diff --use-migra -f <name_of_migration>

# Stop supabase services once you're done
npx supabase stop
```
