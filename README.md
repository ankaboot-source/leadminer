1. **Setup Supabase Instance:**

   - Create an account [here](https://supabase.com/dashboard/sign-up) and create a project.

   - Obtain the following values from your dashboard:

     - **Project URL**: Found under Settings -> API in the "Project URL" section.
     - **Project API key**: Found under Settings -> API in the "Project API keys" section. Use the `service_role` secret.
     - **Project Anon key**: Found under Settings -> API in the "Project API keys" section. Use the `anon` `public` key.
     - **Postgres Connection string**: Found under Settings -> Database in the "Connection string" section. Select the URI option.

   - Configuring authentication with OAuth:

     > **Note:** Currently, Leadminer only supports Google and Azure as third-party OAuth providers. Use "google" for the "PROVIDER_NAME" if integrating Google OAuth and "azure" if integrating Azure.

     - Enable third-party providers in your Supabase dashboard. Refer to the [documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth#configure-third-party-providers) for instructions.
     - Under the "Social Auth" section, select the provider you want to configure and follow the provided [instructions](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth#providers).
     - After creating an OAuth app, go to your app dashboard and add the following URI under the "REDIRECT URI's" section: `http://localhost:8081/api/imap/mine/sources/PROVIDER_NAME/callback`.

2. **Deploy secrets, migrations, edge-functions:**

   Configure the variables inside `./supabase/functions/.env` with supabase credentials from step 1, for other variables reference the backend, frontend .env files to copy the value.

   > - https://supabase.com/docs/guides/functions/deploy
   > - https://supabase.com/docs/guides/functions/secrets

   ```bash
   npx supabase login
   npx supabase link --project-ref <supabase_project_id>
   npx supabase secrets set --env-file ./supabase/functions/.env
   npx supabase db push
   npx supabase functions deploy
   ```

3. **Start docker-compose then navigate to `localhost:8080`:**

   ```shell
   docker-compose up --build --force-recreate
   ```

1. **Start Supabase services:**

   ```sh
   npm run dev:supabase
   ```

2. **Start Redis services:**

   If you prefer to run a Redis container, use the command below. Otherwise, ensure Redis is installed on your machine and skip this step.

   > Note: If you encounter issues connecting to the redis container, make sure to update `REDIS_HOST` in the `.env` file.

   ```shell
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
   ```

3. **Start your environment:**

   ```sh
   npx supabase functions serve
   | npm run dev:frontend
   | npm run dev:backend-api
   | npm run dev:backend-worker
   | npm run dev:backend-email-worker
   | npm run dev:backend-mock-external-services
