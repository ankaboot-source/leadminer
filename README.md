# ‚õè Leadminer

Leadminer is a tool to mine and transmute passive contacts from your own data sources (email mailbox, social networks) into organic and qualified leads.

## Installation
### From source
Install and configure the following dependencies.
* node (version 14 or higher)
* [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-start.html)
* redis

Clone the repository
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/ankaboot-source/leadminer
```
Install the required node modules.
```shell
$ npm install --prefix ./leadminer/backend && npm install --prefix ./leadminer/frontend
```

To configure the application (e.g database host and password), edit `leadminer/backend/config/example.yaml`. When working in production environment, set the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to `production`.

#### Deployment
Start the backend API server.
```shell
$ npm start --prefix ./leadminer/backend & npm start --prefix ./ledminer/frontend
```
### Using Docker Compose
Clone the repository and start docker-compose
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/ankaboot-source/leadminer
$ cd leadminer
```
Edit the configuration in backend as needed and set the `DB_PASSWORD` environment variable to your database password specified in the config.
```
$ export DB_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword
$ docker-compose up
```
We have a CI/CD pipeline that does just that. Check the [deployment workflow yml file](/.github/workflows/Deploy.yml).
