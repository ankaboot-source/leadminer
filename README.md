## üì¶ How to run?

To give it a try without the hassle of installation, [simply use leadminer.io](https://app.leadminer.io/auth/signup). For development purposes, jump directly to [Running with Supabase locally](#running-with-supabase-locally).

> Note that this project integrates with third-party services for email cleaning and enrichment.

  4. Running with Supabase
</strong>
    <br>
    You could either set-up leadminer using Supabase locally or Supabase SaaS. We recommend Supabase locally for now.
<details>
<summary><strong style="display:inline-block" id="running-with-supabase-saas">Running with Supabase SaaS</strong></summary>


1. **Setup Supabase Instance:**

   - Create an account [here](https://supabase.com/dashboard/sign-up) and create a project.

   - Obtain the following values from your dashboard:

     - **Project URL**: Found under Settings -> API in the "Project URL" section.
     - **Project API key**: Found under Settings -> API in the "Project API keys" section. Use the `service_role` secret.
     - **Project Anon key**: Found under Settings -> API in the "Project API keys" section. Use the `anon` `public` key.
     - **Postgres Connection string**: Found under Settings -> Database in the "Connection string" section. Select the URI option.

   - Configuring authentication with OAuth:

     > **Note:** Currently, Leadminer only supports Google and Azure as third-party OAuth providers. Use "google" for the "PROVIDER_NAME" if integrating Google OAuth and "azure" if integrating Azure.

     - Enable third-party providers in your Supabase dashboard. Refer to the [documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth#configure-third-party-providers) for instructions.
     - Under the "Social Auth" section, select the provider you want to configure and follow the provided [instructions](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth#providers).
     - After creating an OAuth app, go to your app dashboard and add the following URI under the "REDIRECT URI's" section: `http://localhost:8081/api/imap/mine/sources/PROVIDER_NAME/callback`.

2. **Deploy secrets, migrations, edge-functions:**

   Configure the variables inside `./supabase/functions/.env` with supabase credentials from step 1, for other variables reference the backend, frontend .env files to copy the value.

   > - https://supabase.com/docs/reference/cli/supabase-login
   > - https://supabase.com/docs/reference/cli/supabase-link
   > - https://supabase.com/docs/reference/cli/supabase-db-push
   > - https://supabase.com/docs/guides/functions/deploy
   > - https://supabase.com/docs/guides/functions/secrets

   ```bash
   npx supabase login
   npx supabase link --project-ref <supabase_project_id>
   npx supabase secrets set --env-file ./supabase/functions/.env
   npx supabase db push
   npx supabase functions deploy
   ```

3. **Start docker-compose :**

   ```shell
   docker-compose up --build --force-recreate -d
   ```
</details>

<details open>
<summary><strong style="display:inline-block" id="running-with-supabase-locally">Running with Supabase locally</strong></summary>



1. **Start Supabase services:**

   ```sh
   npm run dev:supabase
   ```

2. **Start Redis services:**

   If you prefer to run a Redis container, use the command below. Otherwise, ensure Redis is installed on your machine and skip this step.

   > Note: If you encounter issues connecting to the redis container, make sure to update `REDIS_HOST` in the `.env` file.

   ```shell
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
   ```

3. **Start your environment:**

   Start frontend, backend and supabase edge-functions services:

   ```sh
   npm run dev:all
   ```
      </details>
